# 2048 on Steroids

![Sample](./images/sample.jpg)

This is a clone of 2048 board game, developed this time using React. Another plus is some extra gamemodes implemented, like Difficulty levels and Hardcore Mode; a mode that brings empty blocks that can be fixed on the board or move with the natural movements, these empty blocks can't be sumed. Another mod included is Tile Color Customization, so players can choose the color of the tiles or just randomize them.
